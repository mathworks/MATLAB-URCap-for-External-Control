# MATLAB&reg; URCap for External Control
<!-- This is the "Title of the contribution" that was approved during the Community Contribution Review Process --> 

Using the [Robotics System Toolbox&trade; Support Package for Universal Robots UR Series Manipulators](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/117530-robotics-system-toolboxtm-support-package-for-universal-robots-ur-series-manipulators), you can establish ROS communication with Universal Robots manipulators. The matlab_externalcontrol-1.0.0.urcap allows you to create external control of the manipulator over ROS.

## URCap installation 

- To configure the UR series cobots for external control over ROS, the URCap needs to be installed on the Teach pendant of the cobot. Follow the instructions in this [documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/supportpkg/urseries/ug/install-urcap.html) to do the same.
- To configure URSim for external control, follow the instructions [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/supportpkg/urseries/ug/setup-ursim-offline-simulator.html)

## Examples
